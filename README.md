# Jerksdle - A Word Game Clone for Jerks

Jerksdle is a word game clone built as a result of running through a training course on Frontend Masters. It's a simple clone built using `html`, `css`, and plain old vanilla `javascript`. The name comes from my softball team name of the last ~9 years, The Jerks, and has some fun little details that they'll appreciate from this diversion from their productivity.

## v1 Features

- Works almost exactly as the base version of the game
- Utilizes a dev API from the good folks at Frontend Masters to get a random secret word and validate each word guess on app refresh (none of that waiting daily thing üòÅ)

## v2 Updates

- Rebuilt using React 18 and Typescript
- Testing
- Additional animations for win/lose/guess conditions
- More easter eggs for my team to enjoy
